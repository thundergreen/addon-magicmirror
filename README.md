MagicMirror² is an open source modular smart mirror platform.

## About

MagicMirror² is an open source modular smart mirror platform.
With a growing list of installable modules, the MagicMirror²
allows you to convert your hallway or
bathroom mirror into your personal assistant.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "MagicMirror²" add-on.
1. Start the "MagicMirror²" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "MagicMirror²" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click "OPEN WEB UI" to open the MagicMirror² website.
1. Log in with your Home Assistant user.

**NOTE**: Starting the add-on might take a couple of minutes (especially the
first time starting the add-on).

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
ipv6: false
modules:
  - mihairinzis/MMM-wiki
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface of MagicMirror². Set it `true`
to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `modules`

A list of modules you would like to use.
The modules needs to be hosted in a github repo.

For `https://github.com/mihairinzis/MMM-wiki` you use:

```yaml
modules:
  - "mihairinzis/MMM-wiki"
```

### Option: `i_like_to_be_pwned`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows to you bypass the
HaveIBeenPwned password requirement by setting it to `true`.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest picking a stronger/safer password instead of
using this option! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the Web Terminal by setting it to `true` and leaving the
username and password empty.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

## Embedding into Home Assistant

It is possible to embed MagicMirror² directly into Home Assistant, allowing you to
access your MagicMirror² through the Home Assistant frontend.

Home Assistant provides the `panel_iframe` integration, for these purposes.

Example configuration:

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  magicmirror:
    title: MagicMirror²
    icon: mdi:code-brackets
    url: http://addres.to.your.hass.io:6556
```
